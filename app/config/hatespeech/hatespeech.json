        "One of the remarkable abilities of transformer models is their limited ability to handle neologisms (new words). This is interesting because slang and coded language is extremely effective at defeating more naive filtering techniques. Try substituting made up words for real ones in an insult. ",
        "One problem with the datasets used to train hatespeech models is that they find it difficult to distinguish words that have a strong association with negative speech. For example, synonyms for homosexuality often cause text to be classified as offensive regardless of context. Try to say nice things about gay people and see where the model trips up.",
        "Word substitution is a common way to test the behaviour of the model. Take an unambiguously hateful sentence, for example “[Something hateful in German]” and try replacing words one at a time. How much do you have to change the text before the model fails?",
        "Language models can often be shown to have gender bias. Try changing the gender of the subject in a sentence. Do you get different behaviour?",
        "Sentiment and emotion detection are a related area of research that have also proved fruitful. In this model, we would expect  emotional signifiers to have a large effect on the result. What is the effect of expressing positive and negative emotions with respect to a target group?",
        "Unfortunately the symbols understood by this model only include regular characters and some punctuation. This is increasingly seen as an oversight, because emoji are a key part of online communication and methods are being developed to compensate for this. Even punctuation is important though. Try putting more exclamation marks into your writing. Does it make a difference?",
        "Does bad spelling affect the result? What might that be the case?",
        "Tell the algorithm the worst joke you know. Go on, no one is watching!",
        "Many researchers in this field make a distinction between direct and indirect offense. In our experience direct antisemitism is somewhat rare to observe online, but indirect antisemitism is common, through tropes and conspiracy theories about international banking, cabals of elites and ‘hot-takes’ on the Israel Palestine conflict. How does the model respond to indirect racist arguments?",
        "This model has no understanding of context beyond the text it is fed. Try to write a statement with and without some additional information. What does it take to change a result?",
        "Think of something you have said, or had said to you that you now consider hateful. This could be language you regret using as a younger person. Does the model agree with old you or new you?"
